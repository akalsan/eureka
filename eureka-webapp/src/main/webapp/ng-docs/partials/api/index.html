<p>Do you need help understanding the project structure or what services and directives you have available to you
in the Eureka Angular application? You&#39;ve come to the right place!</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-this-documentation" id="eureka-documentation_how-to-use-this-documentation">How to use this documentation</h3>
<p>This code-base is self-documenting; this documentation is automatically generated from comments left throughout
the code. If there is a problem with it, it is because the comments in the code were not updated.</p>
<p>This project is broken down into several modules. Each module represents a section of the application. Inside
each module you will find views, directives, and services specific to that module. This allows you to bite off
code changes in smaller pieces and keeps everything organized in a sane manner.</p>
