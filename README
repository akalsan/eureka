Eureka! Clinical Analytics 1.8 -- An ETL Tool for Loading Data into i2b2.
Center for Comprehensive Informatics, Emory University

OVERVIEW

Welcome to Eureka! Clinical Analytics! Eureka! is a web application
that provides you with an easy way to phenotype a patient population
based on their clinical and administrative data, and load those
phenotypes and data into your own instance of the i2b2 data warehouse
system.

This package contains source code only. For binaries, please go to
http://aiw.sourceforge.net/.

WHAT'S NEW

Version 1.8 adds the ability to connect directly to a database as a
data source, in addition to the spreadsheet upload mechanism.  This
change allows Eureka! to pull patient data directly from a data warehouse.
There are also improvements to the phenotype editor and job submission
user interfaces.

Version 1.7 provides the ability to create new types of phenotypes.
Frequency data elements can now specify the first n occurrences as 
opposed to just n occurrences.  Value Threshold elements can not 
be defined in the "context" of other elements.  The jasig CAS 
(Central Authentication Server) was also incorporated into the 
infrastructure for greater security and Single Sign-On (SSO) ability.  
Other improvements include bug fixes, performance enhancements, 
more complete help documentation, and other data element enhancements.

Version 1.6 extends the rudimentary data element editing support
provided in version 1.5 to provide a complete data element editor. You
can specify a relatively complete set of the temporal patterns that
can be specified in the underlying Protempa software.

REQUIREMENTS

The current version is known to work with Oracle Java 6. It is
expected to work with OpenJDK 6 as well. It is incompatible with Java
7 due to incompatibility of some of its dependencies.

Eureka! Clinical Analytics uses the Maven build system, available from
http://maven.apache.org. You must install maven, if you do not already
have it, to work with the source code. We use Maven 3.
