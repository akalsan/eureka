Eureka Services 1.6-SNAPSHOT -- the middle services layer of Eureka!
Clinical Analytics.  
Center for Comprehensive Informatics, Emory University

OVERVIEW

Welcome to Eureka Services! Eureka Services is the middle services
layer of the Eureka! Clinical Analytics application.

WHAT'S NEW

Version 1.6 extends the rudimentary data element editing support
provided in version 1.5 to provide a complete data element editor. You
can specify a relatively complete set of the temporal patterns that
can be specified in the underlying Protempa software. Version 1.6
SNAPSHOT releases will track the development of this feature.

REQUIREMENTS

The current version is known to work with Oracle Java 6. It is
expected to work with OpenJDK 6 as well. It is incompatible with Java
7.

Eureka! Clinical Analytics uses the Maven build system, available from
http://maven.apache.org. You must install maven, if you do not already
have it, to work with the source code. We use Maven 3.

INSTALLATION

Eureka Services is a module of Eureka! Clinical Analytics and
currently only runs in the context of the entire application. Please
